## Caveats
### Local Storage
UI uses local storage to save all the data.  A middleware needs to be designed and developed for persisting the data

### Search for Alert GUIDs
Alert GUIDs must be double-quoted when being searched on to ensure correctness of results, e.g. guid:"id1".

### Search for Comments
Users cannot search for the contents of the comment's in the Alerts-UI

### Meta alerts
Grouping/faceting requests and other aggregations do not return meta alerts.  This is because it's not clear what the intended results should be when there are multiple matching items.

Sorting has a similar caveat, in that if we are matching on multiple alerts, there is no well defined sort.

Alerts that are contained in a a meta alert are generally excluded from search results, because a user has already grouped them in a meaningful way.

## Prerequisites
* The Metron REST application should be up and running and Elasticsearch should have some alerts populated by Metron topologies
* The Management UI should be installed (which includes [Express](https://expressjs.com/))
* The alerts can be populated using Full Dev or any other setup
* UI is developed using angular4 and uses angular-cli
* node.JS >= 7.8.0

## Installation

### From Source

1. Package the application with Maven:

    ```
    cd metron-interface/metron-alerts
    mvn clean package
    ```

1. Untar the archive in the $METRON_HOME directory.  The directory structure will look like:

    ```
    bin
      metron-alerts-ui
    web
      expressjs
        alerts-server.js
      alerts-ui
        web assets (html, css, js, ...)
    ```

1. Copy the `$METRON_HOME/bin/metron-alerts-ui` script to `/etc/init.d/metron-alerts-ui`

1. [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is installed at `$METRON_HOME/web/expressjs/` as part of the Management UI installation process.  The Management UI should be installed first on the same host as the Alerts UI.

### From Package Manager

1. Deploy the RPM at `/metron/metron-deployment/packaging/docker/rpm-docker/target/RPMS/noarch/metron-alerts-$METRON_VERSION-*.noarch.rpm`

1. Install the RPM with:

    ```
    rpm -ih metron-alerts-$METRON_VERSION-*.noarch.rpm
    ```

### From Ambari MPack

The Alerts UI is included in the Metron Ambari MPack.  It can be accessed through the Quick Links in the Metron service.

## Configuration

The Alerts UI is configured in the `$METRON_HOME/config/alerts_ui.yml` file.  Create this file and set the values to match your environment:

```
port: port the alerts UI will run on

rest:
  host: REST application host
  port: REST applciation port
```

## Usage

After configuration is complete, the Management UI can be managed as a service:

```
service metron-alerts-ui start
```

The application will be available at http://host:4201 assuming the port is set to `4201`.  Logs can be found at `/var/log/metron/metron-alerts-ui.log`.

## Development Setup

1. Install all the dependent node_modules using the following command
    ```
    cd metron/metron-interface/metron-alerts
    npm install
    ```
1. UI can be run by using the following command
    ```
    ./scripts/start-dev.sh
    ```
1. You can view the GUI @http://localhost:4201. The default credentials for login are admin/password

**NOTE**: *In the development mode ui by default connects to REST at http://node1:8082 for fetching data. If you wish to change it you can change the REST url at metron/metron-interface/metron-alerts/proxy.conf.json*

## E2E Tests

An expressjs server is available for mocking the elastic search api.

1. Run e2e webserver :
    ```
    cd metron/metron-interface/metron-alerts
    sh ./scripts/start-server-for-e2e.sh
    ```

1. run e2e test using the following command
    ```
    cd metron/metron-interface/metron-alerts
    npm run e2e
    ```

1. E2E tests uses data from full-dev wherever applicable. The tests assume rest-api's are available @http://node1:8082

**NOTE**: *e2e tests covers all the general workflows and we will extend them as we need*
